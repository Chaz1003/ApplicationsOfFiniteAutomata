"Space Lasers" is a laser shooting game that targets a meteor as its enemy. The mechanic of the game is to shoot the meteor as many times as you can, within 1 minute, to gain points. Each laser that lands a hit is +10 points, and the meteor's health increments by 100 every time it respawns. The spaceship does not have a health mechanic, so it does not take any damage if the meteor hits it.
